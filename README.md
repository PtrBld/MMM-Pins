# MMM-Pins
This is an extension for the [MagicMirror](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror). It can toggle pins specified in the config.

You can specify any number of pins with different trigger messages. All messages will be registered with the [MMM-Remote Module](https://github.com/Jopyth/MMM-Remote-Control) automatically to trigger the messages from the remote control web app but can be triggered from any other module, as well. It can also play sounds using [MMM-Sounds](https://github.com/jc21/MMM-Sounds) module when a pin is toggled.

You should have [MMM-Remote Module](https://github.com/Jopyth/MMM-Remote-Control) and [MMM-Sounds](https://github.com/jc21/MMM-Sounds) installed and configured with your mirror to get the best out of this module ;)
Special thanks therefore goes to Jopyth and jc21 for their amazing work!

## Installation
1. Navigate into your MagicMirror's `modules` folder and execute `git clone https://github.com/ptrbld/MMM-Pins.git`. A new folder will appear navigate into it.
2. Execute `npm install` to install the node dependencies.

## Using the module
First of all connect some leds, etc. to your pins on the pi Raspberry PI. I am using this module currently to turn some 5v leds on and off with TIP120 darlington transistors.

To use this module, add it to the modules array in the `config/config.js` file:
````javascript
modules: [
	{
		module: 'MMM-Pins',
		config: {
			// See 'Configuration options' for more information.
		}
	}
]
````
